<a id="what" class="anchor" href="#what" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What?</h2>

<p>This podcast is a reproduction of the audio portion of Sean Devine's live coding of a charity auction application.</p>

<h2>
<a id="why-audio" class="anchor" href="#why-audio" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why audio?</h2>

<p>I like to preview tech stuff before I actually perform the steps. Sean describes everything along the way, so the pictures aren't really needed for this preview step. I've extracted the audio portion of the videos he posted on YouTube.</p>

<a id="why-a-podcast" class="anchor" href="#why-a-podcast" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why a podcast?</h2>

<p>Since Sean goes through every step in detail, the pace is slow. That's good if you're following along, doing the steps with him. The preview can be done much faster. But how to make the audio faster? There are lots of tools out there for speeding up audio, but the best I've found is the iOS podcast app called Overcast. Even at 3x speed, I can still easily understand what's going on. (Though I have to admit I had to work up to that speed over time. Start at 1.5 and increase whenever you can.)</p>

<a id="did-sean-authorize-this" class="anchor" href="#did-sean-authorize-this" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Did Sean authorize this?</h2>

<p>I haven't even mentioned it to him. Especially since I haven't done anything yet besides write this readme. Since he published the videos on YouTube I'm thinking he intended to share in general. Once I get something working, I'll contact him for permission.</p>
